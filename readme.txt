WordPress plugin that adds settings to the Image block to display different images depending on the width of the screen.

== Description ==

Enable Responsive Image adds settings to the Image block to display different images depending on the width of the screen. You can add multiple images and set media queries and resolution for each image. If the screen width matches the conditions of that media query, it will switch to the corresponding image.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `enable-responsive-image` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin work? =

This plugin rewrites the HTML markup for the image block rendered on the front end. Wrap the img element with a picture element, and add source elements with srcset and media attributes inside the picture element based on the settings of the added image.

= It does not work correctly when multiple image sources are set. =

Try rearranging the order of the images. For example, if both images have a Media Query Type of max-width, the one with the smaller value should be ordered on top.

= Even if I switch the screen width or device on the editor, it does not switch to the set image. =

On the editor side, images do not switch by default. Click the "Enable responsive image preview" button on the block toolbar.

= What filters can I use? =

You can find a list of the available filters in the [Github readme](https://github.com/t-hamano/enable-responsive-image#filters).
